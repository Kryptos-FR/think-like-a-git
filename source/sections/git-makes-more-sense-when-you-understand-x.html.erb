<p>As I mentioned in <%= section_link('why-this-site', 'Why This Site?') %>, I once tried to help a friend learn Git by saying something that&mdash;he later told me&mdash;wasn't all that helpful.  After getting that feedback, I started noticing this pattern:</p>

<p><strong>People tend to say things like "Git makes more sense when you understand [...]".</strong></p>

<p>So I did a quick Google search for that phrase in April 2011, and it turned up over <strong>8 million results</strong>.  (Here,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=git+makes+more+sense+when+you+understand">try it yourself</a>.)</p>

<p>I've chosen a few examples of this pattern to talk about briefly.</p>
